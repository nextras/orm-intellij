# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Fixed autocompletion & reference contribution (ctrl+click) in `findBy()` methods on various complex expression.

## 2.0.0 - 2024-12-15

### Changed

- Dropped support for Orm v3 and v4 - only Orm 5 is supported; specifically, the generics are well supported directly in the PhpStorm, so this functionality got broken/semi-functional here and since Orm 5 utilizes generics properly, this is now not supported here; since Orm 4 is not using generics fully, this plugin will not bring there the type resolution anymore.
- Fix missing support for like operator preventing reference detection in `findBy()` methods.
- Add support for resolving filtering expressions when a relationship is defined by a generic `ManyHasMany<AnotherEntity>`.
- Fix an exception when searching usages.
